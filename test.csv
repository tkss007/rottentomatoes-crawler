Set in Sacramento, California in 2002, amidst a rapidly shifting American economic landscape, Lady Bird is an affecting look at the relationships that shape us, the beliefs that define us, and the unmatched beauty of a place called home.","R (for language, sexual content, brief graphic nudity and teen partying)","Comedy, Drama",Greta Gerwig,Greta Gerwig,"Nov 3, 2017 limited","Mar 6, 2018","$48,285,330",93 minutes,A24,Saoirse Ronan,Laurie Metcalf,Tracy Letts,Lucas Hedges,Timothée Chalamet,Beanie Feldstein,"Lady Bird is a brilliant little movie that deals with ideas both big and small.

It flies.","Lots of movies are set to be popping up in multiplexes, but few as wonderful as ""Lady Bird.""",One of the best movies about adolescence to come along in years.,"It is a female coming-of-age story that is both nostalgic and unflinching, and it will ensnare you deeply in its grasp.",An endearing film experience that's profoundly captivating.

Audiences leave the theater shaken and stirred.","Racism doesn't always have to be virulent, it can sometimes take benevolent and malicious forms as displayed in this haunting and topical film.","Peele's parting thought is not to insist that we are destined to be slaves to the narrow thinking of others, but that we have a responsibility to remain cautious and vocal until such ideas have been destroyed. Get Out is an urgent call to that necessity.","In using both realities in his movie, Peele brings Get Out to a higher level of horror, at least for any person of color in the audience.
